The first class is September 26th, 1000-1200. Ellen Wilkinson Building room 3.17.

Each folder contains the slides in .pdf format, the R script that goes with those slides, and the lab worksheet as an .html file.  All data files for the lectures and the lab classes are included.  To view the .html file, you might need to first download it and then open it within your browser - ensure it has .html at the end of the file name when you save it.
